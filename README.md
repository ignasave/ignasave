### Hello world 

🗺 I'm 22 years old, and im an Argentininan software developer.

💻 I love Programming and I have been a Programmer since I was 15 years old.

🛠 I attended a technical college, where I participated in 2 programming Olympics (OIA) in which I passed to the provincial stage 🥇 (Buenos Aires) and also participated in an Arduino Olympiad at the provincial level and received me from Technician in Personal and Professional Informatics 🖥,

Then I attended 2 Internships in the development company Avalith, where I trained in development work, and learned from senior developers Reactjs 👷‍♂️,
Then I spent 1 year doing various projects and training my frontend skills, this was the year where I’d conceived CaniYA 🏆 !.

👩‍💻 After this year I joined Exactian as a fullstack developer, and almost simultaneously I was able to work overtime as a frontend at my current Gearthlogic job.

During all these years I had the opportunity to see, learn and work with many technologies and languages 🔥,
The latest addition to the list being the Java language.
that I learned it in my second year of the Systems Engineering career.
But of all these technologies the one that I like the most and I feel comfortable with is JavaScript ⚡.
I am someone who does not stop learning, and I am someone who wants to spend as much time as possible studying new things or doing interesting projects.
If you have a project and you need someone to carry it out, I am the right person!
